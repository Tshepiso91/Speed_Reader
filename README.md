Text-to-Speech Web Application
This is a simple web application that converts text into speech using jQuery. The application allows users to enter text in a textarea, and upon clicking the "Start Reading" button, it reads the text word by word at a specified speed. Users can control the reading speed, pause, resume, and restart the reading. The application also displays the reading progress with a progress slider.
